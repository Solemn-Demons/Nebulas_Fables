Interactive Front End Project

Welcome to our group project, Nebula's Fables!

This is a group project to build an interactive (accepting and responding to user input) site using at least two server-side api's. We were tasked with creating a polished user interface using html, css, bootstrap and other frameworks. Our project uses javascript to fecth data from the public NASA Image Library Api and the Mediawiki API. After a few rounds of brainstorming we came up with the idea of being able to search stars, constellations, planets and receive information back regarding their mythological ties.
