this is a comment to test if lexie's branch is working.

Lexie: Working in index.html; I referenced (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_search_menu.asp) for the side search menu. Then I created a placeholder for the map and fixed the links to css and js files. I commented out my demo css and js code for reference.
