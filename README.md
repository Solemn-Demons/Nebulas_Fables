this is a comment to test if lexie's branch is working.

Lexie: Working in index.html; I referenced (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_search_menu.asp) for the side search menu. Then I created a placeholder for the map and fixed the links to css and js files. I commented out my demo css and js code for reference.

Lexie: After duplicating the index.html file to create an about, directory and mythos html files as placeholders, I linked them together in the nav bar and added links to the new javascript files for our APIs. Then I disabled the link to mythos because it is going to have a coming soon modal.
